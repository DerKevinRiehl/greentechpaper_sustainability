## Abstract
Green innovation and technology diffusion must be financially and commercially attractive
to convince corporate decision makers. This paper focuses on the factors that determine the financial
outcome of successful green innovation activities. We employ a large and cross-industry dataset
including more than 97,954 reports on corporate environmentalism from 286 international listed
companies and show hat economic, political, cultural, firm specific, investor related and governance
factors significantly determine the financial performance of green innovation, measured by abnormal
returns. Moreover, we find opposing influence for several factors that benefit earlier stages of
innovation (e.g., research output) while harming the later stages (e.g., market introduction and
financial performance). The findings implicate, that a spatial separation strategy for different stages
of innovation supports corporate environmentalism activities. Moreover, physical property rights,
the governments willingness to support green technologies and economic framework conditions
such as oil price, GDP or public R&D budget need to be balanced by policy makers to address and
stimulate green innovation.
