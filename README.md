## Abstract
Green innovation and technology diffusion must be financially and commercially attractive
to convince corporate decision-makers. This paper focuses on the factors that determine the financial
outcome of successful green innovation activities conducted by large, listed companies. We employ
a cross-industry dataset including more than 97,954 reports on corporate environmentalism from
286 international listed companies. Our results indicate that economic, political, cultural, firmspecific,
investor-related and governance factors significantly determine the financial performance
of green innovation, measured by abnormal returns. Moreover, we can show that factors that
reduce the competition in green innovation markets benefit the financial success of firms operating
on these. Finally, we find an opposing influence for several factors that benefit earlier stages of
innovation (e.g., research output) while harming the later stages (e.g., market introduction and
financial performance). These findings imply, that a spatial separation strategy for different stages
of innovation supports corporate environmentalism activities. Moreover, physical property rights,
the governments’ willingness to support green technologies, and economic framework conditions
such as oil price, GDP, or public R&D budget need to be balanced by policymakers to address and
stimulate green innovation.
